After steady state design,and plot loop transfer function,
I got gain -0.756db and pahse - 171 degrees for wc_des
wc_des is in locis,so phase lead between 31 and 34 degrees needed.
I chose to use negative real zero and phase lead 32 degrees
After phase lead, intersction still exist , so I decreased a small amount of kc.
Next I performed simulation.
